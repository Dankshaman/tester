			"Backgammon",
			"[u][b]BACKGAMMON:[/b][/u]\n\n[b]STARTING POINT:[/b]\nTo play backgammon, each player sits on the long side of the board. One player will be “brown” and the other “white”. Each player moves in an opposite direction and the point is to get all of your pieces to the other side and then in your home slot (basically off the board). Your “home” area is the area where you have the most pieces.  It’s basically a racing game to see who can get all their pieces off the board first. For example, if you are player “brown”, you have to move all of your pieces to your “home” side. Once all pieces are “home”, then you can start removing them into your slot on the board.\n\n[b]BASIC MOVEMENT:[/b]\nAt their turn, players roll both dice and move their pieces towards their home base. The dice are never added together in backgammon, they remain individual but they can be used in sequence to form a greater number..  For example, if you roll a 4+5, you can either move one piece 4 and then 5, or move two pieces, one 4 and the other 5. It may sound like it doesn’t matter, but the actual count of individual die will matter a lot later.\n\n[b]GETTING BUMPED:[/b]\nIf a player lands on your piece, your piece must go to the middle bar area and eventually back to the starting point. If one of your pieces is on the middle bar, you cannot move any of your other pieces until that one is back on the board. On your next turn, you roll the dice and you can only move your piece to an empty space in the starting area, keeping in mind that this is your opponents “home” area. Each triangle is numbered from 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 in that order in your “starting” or “home” areas.\nOnly pieces that are by themselves can be “bumped”. If you have occupied a space with 2 or more pieces, those pieces are safe and cannot be landed on.\n\n[b]GENERAL PLAY:[/b]\nYou move your pieces from your starting area in opposite directions from your opponent. Get all your pieces “home” and then start removing them off the board into the side bar.\nOnce all your pieces are “home”, you roll the dice. Again, the triangles in your home is numbered 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. If you roll a 6 and a 1, then you’d take off one piece from row 6 and one piece from row 1 and put them in your sidebar. If you roll two 5’s and you don’t have any pieces in that slot, then you need to move another piece 5 spaces. So you’d have to move one of your 6’s 5 spaces. If you can’t move or take off a piece, then it’s your opponents turn. This keeps going until one of the players win.\n\n[b]WINNING THE GAME:[/b]\nWhoever gets all their pieces off the board first, wins!\n\nPlease note that these Notepad are one in many out there, but this is a good starting point for one way to play the game.

			"Checkers",
			"[u][b]CHECKERS:[/b][/u]\n\nCheckers (also known as Draughts), is a two-player game. One player is red and one player is black. \n\n[b]GENERAL PLAY:[/b]\nEach player starts with 12 pieces on the three rows closest to their own side. The row closest to each player is called the “King Row“. Black always moves first.\nA player can move in two ways. A piece can be moved forward, diagonally, to the very next dark square. If the other player's piece, and an empty square are lined up, then the first player must “jump“ the other player's piece. In this case, the first player jumps over the other player's piece onto the empty square and takes the other player's piece off the board. A player can also use one piece to make multiple jumps in any one single turn, provided each jump continues to lead immediately into the next jump.\n\n[b]KING ME:[/b]\nIf a player's piece moves into the King Row on the other player's side, it becomes a king. You can either flip the piece to show the crown, or you can stack 2 on top of each other, but turning it over is simpler and you can press alt while hovering over it, if you can’t see the crown too well. A king can move forward and backward. (Regular pieces can only move forward.) A king cannot jump out of the King Row until the next turn. Neither Kings nor regular pieces may move in any direction that is not diagonal.\n\n[b]OPTIONAL VARIANT OF KINGS:[/b]\nInternational play of Checkers can be a bit different, so here is an optional way you can play with the king:\nThe King can capture an opponent's checker or King by jumping over it. The King can jump any distance along a diagonal as long as the following conditions are met:\nThe piece that will be captured must be on the same diagonal as the King.\nThe King can not jump over a piece of its own color.\nThe King can only jump over one piece at a time.\nThere must be at least one empty square just beyond the piece that will be captured.\nThe King does not have to land in the first empty space beyond the piece it has jumped over. The King can choose what space it will land in, unless multiple jumps are available. In that case, the King must land in a space from which it can make the next jump.\n\n[b]WINNING THE GAME:[/b]\nThe first player who cannot move loses. So if a player loses all of his pieces, he loses the game. And if he cannot move, he loses (even if he has pieces). A player may also resign (choose to lose). If nobody can lose, the game is a draw.\n\nPlease note that these Notepad are one in many out there, but this is a good starting point for one way to play the game.

			"Chinese Checkers",
			"[u][b]CHINESE CHECKERS:[/b][/u]\n\nChinese Checkers can be played with 2-6 players.Toss a coin to see who goes first.\n\n[b]GAME OBJECTIVE:[/b]\nThe objective is to be first to race one's pieces across the hexagram-shaped game board into their ”home”, which is the corner of the star opposite one's starting corner, using single-step moves or moves which jump over other pieces. The others continue playing to establish 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and last place finishers.\n\n[b]BASIC MOVEMENT:[/b]\nAt their turn, players move one marble 1 space or hop over any piece. You do not capture pieces in Chinese Checkers. You want to get to your home before the other people. So you need to think one step ahead so you can hop over as many pieces as possible on your turn.\n\n[b]GENERAL PLAY:[/b]\nSince either player can make use of any hopping 'ladder” or “chain” created, a more advanced strategy involves hindering an opposing player in addition to helping oneself make jumps across the board. Of equal importance are the players' strategies for emptying and filling their starting and home corners. Games between top players are rarely decided by more than a couple of moves.\nYou can play one of two ways:\n1. Individual play: Fight for yourself as you race home.\n2. Team play: 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3 battle!\nIn one turn a marble may either be moved into an adjacent hole OR it may make one or more hops over other marbles.  Each hop must be over an adjacent marble and into a the vacant hole directly beyond it.  Each hop may be over any colored marble including the player's own and can proceed in any one of the six directions.  After each hop, the player may either finish or, if possible and desired, continue by hopping over another marble.\n\n[b]WINNING THE GAME:[/b]\nThe first player to get all marbles to their home area, filling all holes in the triangle area, wins!\n\nPlease note that these Notepad are one in many out there, but this is a good starting point for one way to play the game.

			"GO",
			"[u][b]GO:[/b][/u]\n\nGo is a very difficult game with a lot of various rules to it. It’s best to do a search online to get the full details on how to play the game. The information listed below is a very basic starting point to get you going.\n\nGo is a board game for two players. Each player has a set of circular stones. One player (Black) has black stones, and the other (White) has white ones. Black plays first, and the players take turns. On each turn, a player may place a stone on any empty intersection of 2 lines (a point) on the board pass.\n\n[b]HOW TO PLAY:[/b]\nThe board is empty at the beginning of the game\nBlack makes the first move, after which White and Black alternate.\nA move consists of placing one stone of one's own color on an empty intersection on the board.\nA player may pass his turn at any time.\nA stone or solidly connected group of stones of one color is captured and removed from the board when all the intersections directly adjacent to it are occupied by the enemy. \nNo stone may be played so as to recreate a former board position.\nTwo consecutive passes end the game.\nA player's territory consists of all the points the player has either occupied or surrounded.\nThe player with more territory wins.\nOn his turn, a player may either pass (by announcing “pass” and performing no action) or play. A play consists of the following steps (performed in the prescribed order):\nStep 1. Placing a stone of his color on an empty intersection\nStep 2. Removing from the board any stones of his opponent's color that have no liberties.\nStep 3. Removing from the board any stones of his own color that have no liberties.\nA move is defined as a play or a pass. Thus, on each turn a player moves once.\nA player may pass on any move. Usually, passing is beneficial only at the end of the game, when all territory has been claimed and further moves would be useless, or even harmful to a player's position.\n\n[b]THE OBJECTIVE:[/b]\nThe object of go is to control more territory than your opponent. At the end of the game, the player who controls the most territory wins the game.\n\n[b]ADDITIONAL:[/b]\nAt any time in the game, each intersection on the board is in one and only one of the following three states: \n1) empty; 2) occupied by a black stone; or 3) occupied by a white stone. A position consists of an indication of the state of each intersection.\nSpecifying a position involves only the current state of the board. It requires no indication of whose turn it is, nor any information relating to previous moves or states of the board. \n"

			"Pachisi",
			"[u][b]PACHISI:[/b][/u]\n\n[b]GAME OBJECTIVE:[/b]\nThe first player to advance all of his marbles around the board to HOME position from the BASE position, wins. \n\n[b]START UP:[/b]\nA) Players choose their colors based on whatever color their names are./nB) Players then roll one of the dice. Whoever gets the highest number plays first. Play then proceeds clockwise from the first player.\n\n[b]BASIC MOVEMENT:[/b]\nAt their turn, players roll both dice and moves a marble the number of spaces equal to the number shown on the dice. If you roll doubles, you get to roll again.\n\n[b]STARTING OF A MARBLE:[/b]\nA Marble must be started before it can be advanced around the board. To do this, it is moved from the BASE row to the START hole. This is achieved by rolling either a 6 or a 1. A 6 or a 1 only gets the marble positioned. If you roll both a 6 and a 1, you can bring your piece  to the starting position and then move it 6 spaces.\n\n[b]GENERAL PLAY:[/b]\nAfter a marble is started, it is then advanced clockwise along the game path.  The number of spaces it travels is equal to the number as shown on the dice. You count every hole, whether the hole is empty or taken by another player’s marble./nAfter a player has one or more marbles on the game path, when a 1 or 6 is rolled the player the player can either START another new marble or move an existing marble along the way.  Be advised, the movement of the marble will be either 1 or 6, whichever is displayed on the dice. WARNING: If one of your marbles is already in the START hole, you are precluded from starting another marble.  If you have no other marbles to move, or not the available spaces open to move, your turn is lost.\nJumping over or landing on an opponent's marble IS permitted. Jumping over or landing on your own marbles is NOT permitted. If one of your own marbles prevents you from moving another marble the full count on the dice, then you are prevented from moving the “blocked“ marble and your turn is forfeited.\n\n[b]GETTING BUMPED:[/b]\nIf an opposing player turn stops on your marbles exactly, your marble is bumped and  must go back to its BASE row without delay. The abandoned hole is now occupied by your opponent’s marble. This bump can occur anywhere on the board except in their HOME or BASE locations.   \n\n[b][u]BOARD MOVE SHORTCUTS:[/u][/b]\n[b]CENTER HOLE SHORTCUT:[/b] In the center of the board is a single black hole. To take this shortcut, first your marble must be located in one of the black holes located at each point around the board.  Then you get to the center hole by rolling ONLY a 1 on the dice on your next turn. \nWhen you move to the center hole, rolling a 1 on a subsequent turn is the only way out. When you roll a 1 then you move to the closest black hole that leads to your home spot.\n[b]BLACK HOLE SHORTCUT: [/b]  For this shortcut to be activated a marble must land in a black hole with the exact amount on the dice. On the next roll of the dice, the marble can be advanced clockwise around the black holes. You move the marble the number of holes allowed by the roll on the dice around the black holes and then down the path that takes you to the home area with any remaining count on your dice.\nShortcuts are optional. They can be very beneficial because they reduce the time to advance around the board. \n\n[b]THE HOME STRETCH:[/b]\nWhen coming home, you have to end by exact number count registered on the dice.  Since you cannot jump over your own marbles your first marble must go to the farthest home position. If the dice roll gives excess moves to get HOME by the exact count, that marble cannot be advanced. You must either move another marble or forfeit that move.\n\n[b]WINNING THE GAME:[/b]\nThe first player to get all marbles to their home area, wins!\n\nPlease note that these Notepad are one in many out there, but this is a good starting point for one way to play the game.

			"Chess",
			"[u][b]CHESS:[/b][/u]\n\n[b]GAME OBJECTIVE:[/b]\nChess is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of a board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture.\n\n[b]STARTUP:[/b]\nThe player with the white pieces always moves first. White then makes a move, followed by black, then white again, then black and so on until the end of the game.\n\n[b]BASIC MOVES:[/b]\nEach type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square except when capturing an opponent's piece.\nExcept for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is captured (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured .\n\nThe king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).\nA rook moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. It also is moved when castling.\nA bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.\nThe queen moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.\nA knight moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an “L” pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.\n\n[b]PAWNS:[/b]\nA pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.\nPawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).\n\n[b]CASTLING:[/b]\nCastling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it.[2] Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:\nThe king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;\nThere must be no pieces between the king and the rook;\nThe king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);\nThe king and the rook must be on the same rank \n\n[b]PROMOTION:[/b]\nPawns have another special ability and that is that if a pawn reaches the other side of the board it can become any other chess piece (called promotion). A pawn may be promoted to any piece. A pawn is usually promoted to a queen. Only pawns may be promoted. \n\n[b]EN PASSANT:[/b]\nThe last rule about pawns is called “en passant,” which is French for “in passing”. If a pawn moves out two squares on its first move, and by doing so lands to the side of an opponent’s pawn (effectively jumping past the other pawn’s ability to capture it), that other pawn has the option of capturing the first pawn as it passes by. This special move must be done immediately after the first pawn has moved past, otherwise the option to capture it is no longer available. \n\n[b]CHECK & CHECK MATE:[/b]\nA king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.\nA player may not make any move which places or leaves his king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:\nMove the king to a square where it is not threatened.\nCapture the threatening piece (possibly with the king).\nBlock the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece \nIf it is not possible to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the game is over (see the next section).\nIn informal games, it is customary to announce check when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. However, in formal competitions check is rarely announced. \n\n[b]DRAWS:[/b]\nOccasionally chess games do not end with a winner, but with a draw. There are various reasons why a chess game may end in a draw:\nThe position reaches a stalemate where it is one player’s turn to move, but his king is NOT in check and yet he does not have another legal move\nThe players may simply agree to a draw and stop playing\nThere are not enough pieces on the board to force a checkmate (example: a king and a bishop vs.a king)\nA player declares a draw if the same exact position is repeated three times (though not necessarily three times in a row)\nFifty consecutive moves have been played where neither player has moved a pawn or captured a piece.\n\nPlease note that these Notepad are one in many out there, but this is a good starting point for one way to play the game.

If Four are playing, each person can play individually or you can group into two teams.\n\n[b]HOW TO PLAY:[/b]\nThe 28 tiles are shuffled face down. Each player draws seven tiles. The middle of the table is the playing area, so you may need to move the rest of the pieces aside after drawing. Move your pieces into your playing hand so that they remain hidden to everyone but yourself.  Every player can see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by playing the first tile. You can choose how to begin, but usually the person with the highest doubles (ie. double sixes), goes first. \n\nThe second player tries to put a domino on the table that matches one side of what's already there. If a player cannot go, the player picks one domino from the pile and skips that turn. The chain of the played dominoes develops randomly, and can look a lot like a snake.\nContinue taking turns putting dominoes on the board (or picking one from the pile if you cannot go) until someone wins. In regular dominoes, the best strategy is to get rid of doubles first.\n\n[b]WINNING:[/b]\nThe winner is the first person to get rid of all of their dominoes.

During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.\nThe object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]\nTrue Reversi starts with an empty board, and the first two moves by each player are in the four central squares of the board. The players place their disks alternately with their color facing up and no captures are made.\nThe dark player makes the first move.  Dark must place a piece with the dark side up on the board, in such a position that there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another dark piece, with one or more contiguous light pieces between them.\nAfter placing the piece, dark turns over (flips) all light pieces lying on a straight line between the new piece and any anchoring dark pieces. All reversed pieces now show the dark side, and dark can use them in later moves—unless light has reversed them back in the meantime. In other words, a valid move is one where at least one piece is reversed.\nThe light player now plays. This player operates under the same Notepad, with the roles reversed: light lays down a light piece, causing a dark piece to flip. Players keep alternating their turns.\n\n[b]WINNING THE GAME:[/b]\nIf one player cannot make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. When neither player can move, the game ends. This occurs when the grid has filled up, or when one player has no more pieces on the board, or when neither player can legally place a piece in any of the remaining squares.

If there are any aces, place them above the seven piles. If there are no aces, rearrange the cards you have, moving only the face up cards.

			"Mahjong",
			"[u][b]MAHJONG:[/b][/u]\n\nThere are many variations of Mahjong out there, so the Notepad we give below are just one of many. Feel free to look up online the version you’d like to play!\n\n[b]GAME OBJECTIVE:[/b]\nThe game of Mahjong involves drawing and discarding tiles in order to form different melds for going out to win the game. Even though the winner of the hand gets the points from other players, forming the best melds is as important as winning in this game as scoring depends on the content of the hand. The final result and the rank of a player are decided upon adding his points on a number of hands. If we consider a play where 16 hands are played then each player’s final result is calculated on adding the cumulative points scores for each hand.  Mahjong is very similar to Rummy and is played with tiles. The main objective is to build sets with the tiles through drawing and discarding them. \n\n[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]\nPicking The Seats – The players initially assume their seats randomly and they pick up a wind tile each. They then put them face down on the table. Then two tiles, one of odd number and the other of even number, are taken and placed face up on either side of the shuffled wind tiles. The wind tiles are sandwiched between the numbered tiles. Now the two (sometimes three) dice are thrown by a random player and the player indicated by the count on the dice is given with the dice. This player again throws the dice and if the count on the dice is odd he picks the wind tile first at the odd number end and this course of action passes in the counter clockwise direction as the players pick the subsequent tiles. If the dice count is even, the same process is continued starting from the even number end. The player who got the East wind tile takes his respective seat and the remaining players occupy the seats in counter clockwise direction.\nIn a hand each player belongs to a certain wind direction and a wind tile matching the seat’s direction is one’s Seat Wind and melding a Seat Wind would help a player score more points. The East player is referred to as dealer and after each hand (irrespective of a hand won or lost) the players change their seats and therefore change their wind directions. \nThe player on the East throws the dice to determine the side (direction) where the breaking of the wall procedure has to start. Now as the side is determined by the dice count, the player at this point again throws the dice and the number of tiles (stacks) as in the dice count is counted starting from the right end and are shifted apart slightly to show a distinction thus breaking the wall and these tiles are generally referred to as a Dead Wall. The tiles on the left of the Dead Wall are known as a Live Wall.\nImportant Note: The Dead Wall is reserved for the replacement tiles whenever a player has Concealed Kong or when he encounters a flower or season tile. Generally in the Mahjong, whenever a flower or season tile is dealt or drawn from the wall, the tile has to be put aside face up and a replacement tile has to be drawn from the Dead Wall. If the tile drawn from the Dead Wall is again a flower or season tile, this has to be put aside and another tile has to be drawn. When a player has a Concealed Kong, he can retain it to the end of the hand or else he can declare it to pick up a replacement tile.\nDealing The Tiles: East being the priority wind, starts with taking two stacks (that is four tiles) from the Live Wall, followed by the South player taking two stacks, the West player taking two stacks and finally the North player. This continues until the players have twelve tiles each. The players other than the East player pick one tile each and the East player picks two tiles as he has to start formally with the first tile discard. The East player can pick up the last two tiles in two different ways. In one way, he picks two tiles after every other player picks his 12th tile. In a different approach, he picks one tile after everyone has picked his 12th tile and another tile after everyone has picked his 13th. \nDrawing The Tiles: The player to the East side, with an extra tile, starts the play by discarding a tile. The discarded tile is placed face up in the middle of the wall. The player to the right of the dealer may pick up this discarded tile or can draw a tile from the wall. If the discarded tile is not claimed, the player to the dealer's right ie South draws and discards a tile  followed by the West drawing and discarding a tile and finally North drawing and discarding a tile. If the discarded tile is claimed by any of the players, then the player claiming it picks and discards a tile consequently breaking the sequence and the game continues from there.\n\n[b]WINNING THE GAME:[/b]\nA player wins when he or she has reached a combination of four triplets, quadruplets or sequences. The end of a game is signalled when a player declares Mahjong or when there are not any unused tiles left, in which case, no one wins. A winning player automatically receives 20 points. In Mahjong, when a player discards a tile, any of the players can claim the tile to Pung or Kong the tile except for a Chow where a Chow can only be made from the discards of the players on the left.\nIf two players in the game try to claim the same discard there is a priority extended to claim the discard as in the following sequence:\n(1) Going out (declaring Mahjong).\n(2) Kong or Pung.\n(3) Chow.\n(4) When two players claim the same tile for declaring Mahjong the player to the right of the thrower wins.\nOn making four sets of Chow, Pung, Kong and Pair a player can declare loud Mahjong asserting his or her win. A winning hand has 14 tiles in total. After each round the seating position changes or rotates in counter clockwise even if there is a dead hand, where none of players wins.\n"
